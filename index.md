		<h4>Go for Zero Warnings</h4>
		<p>
		Compiler warnings are only useful if you read them. Once they start piling up, 
		you stop reading them and you might mis critical warnings that cause bugs. The 
		only way is to keep your number of warnings to zero. Marker Manager helps you do this.

    <div class="col-md-6">
		<h4>Any Lanuguage</h4>
		<p>
		Manage your compiler warnings for any programming language. Be it Python, Java, C++, 
		Verilog, VHDL or your own proprietary domain specific language. One tool deals with 
		compiler output for all languages.

        <h4>Suppress</h4>
        <p>Suppress warnings in any programming language, simply by 
        writing a commented annotation in your code.

    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h4>Export</h4>
        <p>
        Export the warnings, note and errors from your Eclipse project. 
        You can add these as "lint" report when you deliver your code.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h4>Import</h4>
        <p>
        Import compiler warnings from other tools. Run lint tools or 
        other analysis tools independently and import their output. 
        Warning icons will show up in the source code, so that it is easy to fix them.
